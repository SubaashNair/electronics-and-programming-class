Lesson 5
=========

Goal: Add a DC motor to another PWM pin and make something move.

The students should understand how to drive a motor, and possible how to use
the built-in Arduino libraries.

Goal: Test all remaining sensors - photocell, whatever we didnâ€™t get to.

Optional Goal: Add a servo to another PWM pin to have more precise control over
physical movement.

Bonus Goal: Create a 6-LED meter using a shift register and an analog input sensor.

Bonus Goal: Add a shift register to the board along with 8 LEDs. Write a function to
light up x number of LEDs.
