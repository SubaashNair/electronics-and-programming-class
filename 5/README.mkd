Lesson 5
=========

Goal: Test all remaining sensors - photocell, whatever we didnâ€™t get to.

Optional Goal: Add a servo to another PWM pin to have more precise control over
physical movement.

Bonus Goal: Create a 6-LED meter using a shift register and an analog input sensor.

Bonus Goal: Add a shift register to the board along with 8 LEDs. Write a function to
light up x number of LEDs.

## Supplies

* Breadboard from last time, which should have
    * RGB LED
    * 4x 220 ohm resistor
    * push button
    * 7 jumper wires
* 1cm square block of static dissipative foam
* 2 more jumper wires (possibly wire cut from spool, need to test if jumper
  wires are strong enough to punch through foam)
* 1 10k ohm resistor
* Potentiometer

## Schedule (for 2 hour session)

1. Setup (10 minutes) - Get laptop and other supplies, download code from
   previous session.
1. Serial console with digital inputs - fix the problem from last time by
   connecting button to GND and using pinMode of INPUT_PULLUP. (15 minutes)
1. Serial console with analog inputs (15 minutes)
1. Analog input, test with variable resistor - control brightness of LED (20
   minutes)
    1. Bonus goal - control blink rate of LED or color hue
1. Break (10 minutes)
1. Build and test an analog force sensor, combine with variable resistor to
   control 2 outputs at once (30 minutes)
1. Pick one of three other sensors/output devices to try and follow online
   tutorial:
   1. Servo, make things move - take servo and 6 jumper wiresjkkkk
   1. Photocell, detect light
   1. Shift register, control a large number of LEDs at once:

1. Clean-up - last 10 min
